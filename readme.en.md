## FAQ

* **What is security circle ? what's the benifits of joinning security circle? How to join security circle?**

**What is security circle**

Security circle is a credit circle established by every pi member, consists of 3 -5 members.All the pi member in the security circle form the global credit graph to project currency, and to prevent deceptive trading.



**The benifit of security group**

Unlike bitcoin or other coins leverage POW to protect their ledger, pi protect ledger by the member's mutual trust.

Pi contributor set up security circle and select and ensure 3-5 members they trust. Security group should be combined with members you trust, and they will not execute deceptive trading. The security circle net form a global trust graph, to assure who is able to execute trading on the trusted pi ledger.

what's more, security group is also a  mining fleet, by launch security group and mine with your friends, both of you can level up your mining speed!

**How to build security group**

when we finish three days mining circle, that is 72 hours later(keep in mind it is your mining time instead of register time), you can build up a security group. After the security circle set up for one day, our mining speed would multiple twice.

tap the little flash, if the ui enter into the EDIT SECURITY CIRCLE, that means you already mine 72 hours in total,  if no yellow flash present, that means it is not the moment, keep up!

when security circle successfully set up, go back to the main page and you will find a shield on the right side, if the shield is 100%, that means the security circle already increase the maximum calculation power.Tap the shield and see the detail. 

* **My friends registered pi network, but I invite my friends to my security group**

pi is published in many countries, only the phone number without country code can't locate correctly.now the solution is to add country code before your phone number. China can add `+86` prefix, go back and you will be able to invite your friends.

* **When can I collect pi,  what's the meaing of the flash backgroud color, how long it takes to launch the next collection cirle?**

  as long as you tap the little flash, the 24 hours count down begin, when count down to 0, you can collect and you will be in inactive state, when you tap again, you will be in active state.Note that inactive state will not gain extra calculation power.The green flash means it is collecting, grey time to collect, and red warning your account has problem.You can get the count down information in profile.
